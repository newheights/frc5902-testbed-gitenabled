PID and how to tune an auto:

CALCULATING DISTANCE:

Your distance measurement is set at motor configuration in driveTrain.java
In order to calculate this measure take your target (in terms of inches) and then do the following:
4096 * (target / (3.14*6))
4096 is a magic number. Don't ever touch it.

----> NOTE <----
This assumes that you have a 6" wheel, and the encoder is mounted to the wheel.
If your encoder is mounted before the gearbox then the following operation should be used:

w * (4096 * (target / (3.14*6)))

Where w is the number of times that your motor will spin for your wheel to spin once.

TUNING THE PID ITSELF:

All PID tuning is done in driveTrain.java
There is a comment there that describes this process in great detail.
